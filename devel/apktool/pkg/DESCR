apktool is a tool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary
Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and
rebuild them after making some modifications; it makes possible to debug
smali code step by step. Also it makes working with app easier because
of project-like files structure and automation of some repetitive tasks
like building apk, etc.
