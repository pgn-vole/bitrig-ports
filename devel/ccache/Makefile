# The ccache(1) manual page causes ERRORs with mandoc(1),
# so normally this port would require USE_GROFF.
# However, the actual formatting issues are not very serious,
# and USE_GROFF would cause a circular dependency
# because the textproc/groff port can use ccache.
# When updating, please check that mandoc(1) still
# does not drop any content from the ccache(1) manual.
