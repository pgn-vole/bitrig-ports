TLS configuration
=================
logstash-forwarder will require the usage of an encrypted connection. In
order to set this up do not follow the instructions in in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/logstash-forwarder/README.md as those instructions
are incorrect. Instead generate the certificate and keys with a command
like:

  openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout \
	logstash.key -out logstash.crt -days 365

and ensure you enter a valid CN.

Configure logstash
==================
In order for logstash to receive the events from logstash-forwarder, a
configuration block like the following is needed:

  input {
      lumberjack {
      # The port to listen on
      port => 12345

      # The paths to your ssl cert and key
      ssl_certificate => "/path/to/logstash.crt"
      ssl_key => "/path/to/logstash.key"

      # Set this to whatever you want.
      type => "logs"
    }
  }

Adjust 'ssl_key', 'ssl_certificate' and 'port' as needed to match your
setup.
