To start a session bus instance of dbus-daemon (needed by applications
installing ${PREFIX}/share/dbus-1/services/*.service files), add the
following lines in .xinitrc or .xsession before starting the window
manager (see dbus-launch(1) for more info) -- note that the default
xinitrc and Xsession in OpenBSD (as well as some session/login managers,
e.g. gnome-session(1)) already do this for you in which case these lines
are not needed.

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/bin/dbus-launch -a -z "${DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS}" ]; then
	eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session`
fi
