| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Zabbix web frontend has been installed into
${PREFIX-web}/zabbix

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
    # ln -s ../zabbix /var/www/htdocs/zabbix
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

Zabbix Web can work with a PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite3 database.
Support for SQLite3 is included with the main php package; to use
another database, the corresponding package needs to be installed:
    php-pgsql or php-mysqli

The web frontend works reasonably well with OpenBSD's chroot'ed
httpd (the "Status of Zabbix" page uses /bin/ps and /dev/kmem to
check the process, so it erroneously reports it as not running).
Some changes from the default configuration are required -
you can do this by creating symbolic links as follows:

    # ln -s ${PREFIX-web}/conf/modules.sample/zabbix.conf \
      ${PREFIX-web}/conf/modules

    # ln -fs ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${MODPHP_VERSION}.sample/zabbix.ini \
      ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${MODPHP_VERSION}/zabbix.ini

Zabbix requires a timezone to be configured in PHP; zabbix.ini
sets this to UTC, you may like to adjust this. After making these
changes, stop and start httpd.

At last, edit ${ZABBIX_WEB}/conf/zabbix.conf.php according to your needs.
