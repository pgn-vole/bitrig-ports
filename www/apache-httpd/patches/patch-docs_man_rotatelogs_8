 -f
-Causes the logfile to be opened immediately, as soon as rotatelogs starts, instead of waiting for the first logfile entry to be read (for non-busy sites, there may be a substantial delay between when the server is started and when the first request is handled, meaning that the associated logfile does not "exist" until then, which causes problems from some automated logging tools)

 -t
 Causes the logfile to be truncated instead of rotated\&. This is useful when a log is processed in real time by a command like tail, and there is no need for archived data\&. No suffix will be added to the filename, however format strings containing '%' characters will be respected\&.
